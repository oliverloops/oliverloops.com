<h2 className="mt-6 text-2xl font-bold">What Is Conditional Rendering?</h2>

<p className="break-words text-md text-left leading-relaxed text-gray-700 dark:text-white">
  When you work with React, sometimes you need to show or hide a component’s
  content. For example, when you load a website like Medium, Twitter, or Airbnb,
  you see a skeleton instead of content. Or maybe you’ve seen a loader animation
  before a component is loaded. That’s because the website needs to load, fetch,
  or request any resource, and it’s showing you this skeleton or animation
  representing a loading status in the meantime.
</p>

    src={"/static/images/blog_img/intro-to-react/skeleton.png"}
    alt={"Medium Skeleton"}
    layout="responsive"
    width={480}
    height={250}
  />
  <figcaption className="text-center text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-300 text-xs pt-2">
    Medium showing a skeleton before the content loads.
  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p className="break-words text-md text-left leading-relaxed text-gray-700 dark:text-white">
  This is the most common example, but conditional rendering is really helpful when you need to hide or show content that needs to be unlocked after any event or side effect. 
  Conditional rendering is also helpful if you need to show a loader before any component finishes their fetching/requesting process or you want to pull out elements inside 
  the view without re-rerendering the entire window or modifying a complex state.

<h2 className="mt-6 text-2xl font-bold">
  OK, but My Code Looks Weird and Verbose Now
</h2>

<p className="break-words text-md text-left leading-relaxed text-gray-700 dark:text-white">
  When you implement this feature inside a component, you find different ways to
  accomplish that. The first one is using{" "}
  <code className="bg-gray-200 dark:bg-gray-500  px-1">if</code>/
  <code className="bg-gray-200 dark:bg-gray-500  px-1">else</code> statements
  using a boolean value to decide what should be rendered or not, but sometimes
  this is not a really good solution because the conditional statements could
  re-render the entire component. If this is connected to a lifecycle method,
  you could find this implementation not very beneficial. Another problem is
  that even if you don’t wrap your UI elements inside an individual component,
  this generates less readable components thanks to the use of curly braces, the
  conditional <code className="bg-gray-200 dark:bg-gray-500  px-1">&&</code>
  operator, or even the inline <code className="bg-gray-200 dark:bg-gray-500  px-1">
    if
  </code>/<code className="bg-gray-200 dark:bg-gray-500  px-1">else</code> statement
  syntax (the conditional ternary operator). That’s the reason why I created React
  Hider.
</p>

<h2 className="mt-6 text-2xl font-bold">React Hider in a Nutshell</h2>

<p className="break-words text-md text-left leading-relaxed text-gray-700 dark:text-white">
  React Hider is a minimalist library that can be used to make conditional
  rendering simpler and code cleaner. Thanks to just one component that does the
  conditional rendering for you, it increases productivity and saves time spent
  reading or creating code. Getting started is quite simple. Just install the
  library through NPM:
</p>

<figure className="md:px-5 md:mt-4 md:mb-5">
  <Image
    src={"/static/images/blog_img/intro-to-react/terminal_script.png"}
    alt={"Medium Skeleton"}
    layout="responsive"
    width={700}
    height={48}
  />
</figure>

<p className="break-words text-md text-left leading-relaxed text-gray-700 dark:text-white">
  Import the <code className="bg-gray-200 dark:bg-gray-500  px-1">Hider</code>{" "}
  inside any pre-configured React project you want:
</p>

<figure className="md:px-5 md:mt-4 md:mb-5">
  <Image
    src={"/static/images/blog_img/intro-to-react/first_line.png"}
    alt={"Medium Skeleton"}
    layout="responsive"
    width={700}
    height={276}
  />
</figure>

<p className="break-words text-md text-left leading-relaxed text-gray-700 dark:text-white">
  And using the component is simple as well. First, set an initial boolean state
  depending on your component’s requirements:
</p>

<figure className="md:px-5 md:mt-4 md:mb-5">
  <Image
    src={"/static/images/blog_img/intro-to-react/second_line.png"}
    alt={"Medium Skeleton"}
    layout="responsive"
    width={700}
    height={254}
  />
</figure>

<p className="break-words text-md text-left leading-relaxed text-gray-700 dark:text-white">
  Now it’s time to use the{" "}
  <code className="bg-gray-200 dark:bg-gray-500  px-1">Hider</code> component to
  wrap the components that you need to show/hide. The first one needs to be the
  component to show and the second one the component to hide. After that, just
  provide the actual boolean status declared before to the state prop inside
  Hider:
</p>

<figure className="md:px-5 md:mt-4 md:mb-5">
  <Image
    src={"/static/images/blog_img/intro-to-react/third_line.png"}
    alt={"Medium Skeleton"}
    layout="responsive"
    width={700}
    height={430}
  />
</figure>

<p className="break-words text-md text-left leading-relaxed text-gray-700 dark:text-white">
  I need to say that this library is capable of showing/hiding a single child
  component because Hider is based on React’s conditional{" "}
  <code className="bg-gray-200 dark:bg-gray-500 px-1">&&</code> operator too.
  You just need to worry about which elements need to be rendered or not.
</p>

<h2 className="mt-6 text-2xl font-bold">You’re Done!</h2>

<p className="break-words text-md text-left leading-relaxed text-gray-700 dark:text-white">
  And that’s everything you need to know to use React Hider inside any future
  project, Thanks for reading and feel free to contribute.
