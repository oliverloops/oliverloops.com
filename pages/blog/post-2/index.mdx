<h2 className="mt-8 mb-4 text-2xl font-bold">To begin</h2>

<p className="break-words text-md text-left leading-relaxed text-gray-700 dark:text-white">
  Since the introduction of React Hooks on React 16.8 version the way we build
  features based on state management, prop drilling, event handling and a lot
  more has been changed. But doesn’t matter that all this new approaches came in
  a certain way to “replace” class based state management, a lot of open source,
  startup and business projects are still using the whole class based React
  environment and a lot of developers should actually maintain all this projects
</p>

<p className="break-words text-md text-left leading-relaxed text-gray-700 dark:text-white">
  We could spend the whole day arguing why we should start using react hooks in
  every project we build but that’s a discussion for other day, it’s quite
  important to consider that we still need to know how the entire library works
  and yes that includes the classic this.state and this.setState formula for
  built-in state management.
</p>

<h2 className="mt-8 mb-4 text-2xl font-bold">The First Mask 🎭</h2>

<p className="break-words text-md text-left leading-relaxed text-gray-700 dark:text-white">
  I’ll want to begin with the most common way to use this.setState, using just
  and object as a parameter and changing the initial state through attributes as
  we can see on the next example using a simple apple(s) increment button:
</p>

<figure className="md:px-5 md:mt-4 md:mb-5">
  <Image
    src={"/static/images/blog_img/the-3-masks/block_one.png"}
    alt={"block one"}
    layout="responsive"
    width={350}
    height={220}
  />
</figure>

<p className="break-words text-md text-left leading-relaxed text-gray-700 dark:text-white">
  as you see we incorporate the this.setState into a method called toBasket,
  that will be integrated and called through the onClick event as you see
  bellow:
</p>

<figure className="md:px-5 md:mt-4 md:mb-5">
  <Image
    src={"/static/images/blog_img/the-3-masks/block_two.png"}
    alt={"Block Two"}
    layout="responsive"
    width={400}
    height={200}
  />
</figure>

<p className="break-words text-md text-left leading-relaxed text-gray-700 dark:text-white">
  I know that’s a simple example but I will add the expected result bellow:
</p>

<figure className="md:px-5 md:mt-4 md:mb-5">
  <Image
    src={"/static/images/blog_img/the-3-masks/example_one.gif"}
    alt={"example one"}
    layout="responsive"
    width={300}
    height={200}
  />
</figure>

<p className="break-words text-md text-left leading-relaxed text-gray-700 dark:text-white">
  this is quite common and one of the first things to know and grab when we
  started to learn React, now let’s move to the interesting part.
</p>

<h2 className="mt-8 mb-4 text-2xl font-bold">The Second Mask 👺</h2>

<p className="break-words text-md text-left leading-relaxed text-gray-700 dark:text-white">
  Maybe you’re asking for: which other functionality offers this method?
</p>

<p className="break-words text-md text-left leading-relaxed text-gray-700 dark:text-white">
  Well imagine that you want to run a function that needs the updated state, if
  we execute a function that will use the new state this one will return the old
  state because the updated one takes effect just after rendering step. In this
  case this.setState provides the option to pass a function as an additional
  parameter that can access to the new state as you can see on the example
  bellow adding a console.log that show us the updated state’s value:
</p>

<figure className="md:px-5 md:mt-4 md:mb-5">
  <Image
    src={"/static/images/blog_img/the-3-masks/block_three.png"}
    alt={"Block Three"}
    layout="responsive"
    width={480}
    height={250}
  />
</figure>

<p className="break-words text-md text-left leading-relaxed text-gray-700 dark:text-white">
  this console.log returns the old state because it’s executed before rendering
  step and when the Add more apples button it’s pressed we see that result
  projected in both DOM and console:
</p>

<figure className="md:px-5 md:mt-4 md:mb-5">
  <Image
    src={"/static/images/blog_img/the-3-masks/example_two.gif"}
    alt={"example two"}
    layout="responsive"
    width={480}
    height={250}
  />
  <figcaption className="text-center text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-300 text-xs pt-2">
    NOTE: I initialized the state to 0 and extra text inside the JSX was added.
  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p className="break-words text-md text-left leading-relaxed text-gray-700 dark:text-white">
  now if we use the second implementation (passing an anonymous function as a
  second parameter to this.setState) it will looks like this:
</p>

<figure className="md:px-5 md:mt-4 md:mb-5">
  <Image
    src={"/static/images/blog_img/the-3-masks/block_four.png"}
    alt={"block four"}
    layout="responsive"
    width={450}
    height={250}
  />
</figure>

<p className="break-words text-md text-left leading-relaxed text-gray-700 dark:text-white">
  we obtain the same exact updated result on both console and DOM:
</p>

<figure className="md:px-5 md:mt-4 md:mb-5">
  <Image
    src={"/static/images/blog_img/the-3-masks/example_two.gif"}
    alt={"example two"}
    layout="responsive"
    width={480}
    height={250}
  />
</figure>

<p className="break-words text-md text-left leading-relaxed text-gray-700 dark:text-white">
  with this in mind it’s correct to say that this.setState it’s actually an
  asynchronous function and by the way the function used as a second parameter
  is considered a callback.
</p>

<h2 className="mt-8 mb-4 text-2xl font-bold">The Third Mask 👹</h2>

<p className="break-words text-md text-left leading-relaxed text-gray-700 dark:text-white">
  And last but not least there are a different and more efficient way to write
  this.setState and it’s called the functional way and this is quite simple to
  write, just need to replace the object component with a function that receives
  the state and could receive even a prop as parameters the only aspect to
  consider is that this.setState must return an object with the state changes as
  we see bellow:
</p>

<figure className="md:px-5 md:mt-4 md:mb-5">
  <Image
    src={"/static/images/blog_img/the-3-masks/block_five.png"}
    alt={"block five"}
    layout="responsive"
    width={450}
    height={250}
  />
</figure>

<p className="break-words text-md text-left leading-relaxed text-gray-700 dark:text-white">
  this way of expressing this.setState returns the same expected state changes
  that the first one (just an object as a parameter way) just resulting into:
</p>

<figure className="md:px-5 md:mt-4 md:mb-5">
  <Image
    src={"/static/images/blog_img/the-3-masks/example_four.gif"}
    alt={"example four"}
    layout="responsive"
    width={480}
    height={250}
  />
</figure>

<p className="break-words text-md text-left leading-relaxed text-gray-700 dark:text-white">
  and we even could manage complex tasks considering that we have instantly
  access to props values, it’s recommended to implement this third way over the
  first one whenever is posible in order to avoid weird behaviors after or
  during the event lifecycle.
</p>

<h2 className="mt-8 mb-4 text-2xl font-bold">Here’s the end</h2>

<p className="break-words text-md text-left leading-relaxed text-gray-700 dark:text-white">
  We could consider a lot of things around this useful method like all the
  lifecycles specific methods or how the built-in state management functionality
  interacts with third party libraries and a lot more but this is just a
  practical and easy to grab tutorial just to really see the general
  capabilities of this.setState method at the end it’s important to have in mind
  that this method is not limited to receive just an object as a parameter.
