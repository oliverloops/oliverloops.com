  For the better part of the last year, I've been investing heavily in front-end
  development and design. When I started my new role at Hy-Vee, I identified a
  need for a component library and created it. Since then, I've learned a lot
  about style guides, design systems, component libraries, and their best
  practices. This post will be a deep-dive on everything I've learned in the
  past year.
