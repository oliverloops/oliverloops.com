  Since the introduction of React Hooks on React 16.8 version the way we build
  features based on state management, prop drilling, event handling and a lot
  more has been changed. But doesn’t matter that all this new approaches came in
  a certain way to “replace” class based state management, a lot of open source,
  startup and business projects are still using the whole class based React
  environment and a lot of developers should actually maintain all this projects

<p className="break-words text-md text-left leading-relaxed text-gray-700 dark:text-white">
  We could spend the whole day arguing why we should start using react hooks in
  every project we build but that’s a discussion for other day, it’s quite
  important to consider that we still need to know how the entire library works
  and yes that includes the classic this.state and this.setState formula for
  built-in state management.
